          <p className="intro-text">
            I‚Äôm an enthusiastic and motivated individual with a deep interest in technology and creativity. 
            My journey began in the lively city where I was born on <strong>13th November 2001</strong>. 
            Ever since my childhood, I have always been curious about how things work ‚Äî 
            whether it‚Äôs a simple gadget or a complex system. That curiosity led me into the world of <strong>Computer Science</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            I completed my schooling at <strong>Sri Ramakrishna Matric Higher Secondary School</strong> where I built 
            a strong foundation in academics and teamwork. Later, I pursued my <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering</strong> 
            from <strong>Dr. M.G.R. University</strong>, where I discovered my passion for coding, design, and developing smart solutions.

          <p>
            My family has been my biggest support system ‚Äî my father, <strong>Saleem Basha</strong>, 
            my mother, <strong>Sahera Banu</strong>, and my sister, <strong>Niha Banu</strong>, 
            have always encouraged me to chase my dreams with dedication and humility.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of academics, I find joy in both <strong>indoor and outdoor games</strong>. 
            Whether it‚Äôs chess or cricket, I love challenges that keep my mind and body active. 
            I‚Äôm also deeply <strong>enthusiastic about cars and bikes</strong> ‚Äî the thrill of riding and exploring new roads 
            gives me an incredible sense of freedom. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Whenever life gets busy, my favorite way to relax is by <strong>listening to music</strong> or 
            <strong>spending quality time with friends</strong>. Those small moments of laughter and fun 
            are what keep me balanced and energized to take on new challenges.
          </p>

          <p className="closing-line">
            I believe in continuous learning, staying positive, and growing a little more every single day. 
            My goal is to combine my technical knowledge and creativity to make a meaningful impact in the IT world. üöÄ
